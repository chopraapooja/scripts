# scripts #
* **git-init.sh :** Every project starts with mkdir command and takes next step to initalize a git repo with basic files(README.md, .gitignore etc.). This shell-script saves you from writting 8-10 lines of usual boring commands (e.g. cd, touch, echo, git add, commit, set remote origin, push etc.) in your terminal.

  - Creates project dir.
  - Initialize README.md and .gitignore.
  - Makes initial commit.
  - Pushes initial commit to github.
